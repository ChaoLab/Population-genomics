# Population-genomics-analysis

This repository contains various analysis scripts for analysis of microbial [population genomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_genomics) -- a valuable tool to define and delimit species and to understand the mechanisms that drive and maintain speciation.

The following modules were employed in this [study]():

SNP_density_plot

recombination_inference

population_structure_inference

dS_clustering_for_recombined_genes




Here is the list of common software used for population genomics analysis:
