# Population-genomics-analysis

This repository contains various analysis scripts for analysis of microbial [population genomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_genomics) -- a valuable tool to define and delimit species and to understand the mechanisms that drive and maintain speciation.

The following modules were employed in this [study]():

1. SNP density plot

2. Recombination inference

3. Population structure inference

4. Recombined genes inference based on pairwise dS values
