This pipeline can calculate and visualize the SNP density along the genome.

**Input**: 

1. core genome alignments from Mauve
2. recombination regions identified from ClonalFrameML

- (These two can refer to the results [here](https://github.com/Xiaojun928/Population-genomics/tree/master/recombination_inference))

3. genomic position of genes subjeted to recombination
- ds_chr_genes.txt
- ds_pls_genes.txt

**Output**

SNP density plot
